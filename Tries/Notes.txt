Trie
  - A kind of tree but not binary tree
  - The root is None and all other nodes can have multiple children (k-ary)
  - reTRIEval
  - Other names: Digital / Radix / Prefix tree

     root
  B       C
A   O     A
G   Y     T

Applications
  - Autocompletion

Operation
  - Lookup: O(L) L is the length of word to lookup
  - Insert: O(L)
  - Delete: O(L)

Traverse a Trie
  - pre-order traversal : root -> leaf
      - good to print a word in the Trie
  - post-order traversal : leaf -> root
      - good to delete a word in the Trie
