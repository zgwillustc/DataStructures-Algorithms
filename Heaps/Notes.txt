Complete tree
  - A tree in which every level, except possibly the deepest, is entirely filled. At the deepest level, all nodes are as far left as possible.

Heap
  - A complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property:
    - The value of node is equal to or greater than its children -> Max Heap
    - The value of node is equal to or less than its children -> Min Heap

Applications
  - Sorting (HeapSort)
  - Graph algorithms (shortest path)
  - Priority queues
  - Finding the kth smallest/largest value

Operation
  - insert(): O(log n)     log n is the height of the tree
  - remove(): O(log n)
  - findmax(): O(1) - Max Heap
  - findmin(): O(1) - Min Heap

Heap can be implemented using Array, although it is tree.
          Node (index)
            20 (0)
      10 (1)      15 (2)
4 (3)       5 (4)

leftChildIndex = parentIndex * 2 + 1
rightChildIndex = parentIndex * 2 + 2
parentIndex = (childIndex - 1) // 2

Heapify
  - No need to Heapify the leaf nodes at the last level
  - lastParent = n // 2 - 1

Find kth largest number in a list
