Tree -> Nodes - Root & Leaf
Root: node has children - depth = 0
Leaf: node has no children - height = 0

Binary Tree -> each node has a maximum of two children

Binary Search Tree
left.value < node.value < right.value
all left                  all right

isBST - Recursion
Minimum value of a binary search tree is the leftmost node value
Maximum value of a binary search tree is the rightmost node value

Operations in Binary Search Tree
Lookup O(log n)
Insert O(log n)
Delete O(log n)


Tree Traversal
  - Breadth first
      - level order traversal
  - Depth first
      - pre-order traversal:  root -> left -> right
      - in-order traversal:   left -> root -> right
            - traverse on a binary search tree -> values in ascending order
      - post-order traversal: left -> right -> root
            - leaf nodes first
                    - Height of Tree
                    - Minimum value in a Tree


Depth and Height of Tree
 - Depth: Count from root to leaf (maximum path)
 - Height: Count from leaf to root (maximum path) - post-order traversal


Nodes at K Distance from the Root - Recursion
