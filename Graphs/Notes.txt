Graphs
 - To represent connected objects

Applications
  - Shortest path
  - Find the order to process a series of jobs/projects that depend on each other - topological sorting

node - vertex (vertices)
adjacent - neighbor
edge
weight

Directed graph
Undirected graph

(number of nodes/vertices - V; number of edges - E)
(A dense graph: every node is connected to all other nodes -> E = V*(V-1))
Implementation of graphs
  - Adjacency Matrix -> 2D array ; a hash table to store the indexes of all nodes
          - Space complexity: O(V^2)
          - Add node: O(V^2)
          - Remove node: O(V^2)
          - Add edge: O(1)
          - Remove edge: O(1)
          - Query edge: O(1)
          - Find neighbors: O(V)
  - Adjacency List -> An array of linked lists ; a hash table to store the indexes of all nodes
          - Space complexity: O(V+E) - worst case: O(V^2)
          - Add node: O(1)
          - Remove node: O(V^2)
          - Add edge: O(K) K is the number of edges a given node has - worst case: O(V)
          - Remove edge: O(K) - worst case: O(V)
          - Query edge: O(K) - worst case: O(V)
          - Find neighbors: O(K) - worst case: O(V)
 * Use Adjacency Matrix for very dense graphs
 * Otherwise Adjacency List is more efficient


Traversal in Graph
  - Depth first search
      - Recursion
      - Iteration - use Stack
  - Breadth first search
      - Iteration - use Queue


Topological Sort
  - Work on graphs without cycles - directed acyclic graph
  - May get different results

Cycle Detection
  - three sets containing nodes: all, visiting, visited
  - Hash table to store the elements in the cycle
